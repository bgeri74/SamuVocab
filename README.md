# SamuVocab, exp. 7, cognitive mental organs: MPU (Mental Processing Unit), acquiring higher-order knowledge


- In order to use this project, you must have Python installed on your computer. The suggested version is 3.4.

- The agent learns and recognizes a vocabulary of 20 words. It is shown in video at https://youtu.be/KGUrMSvD4RI
- The agent is learning and recognizing a vocabulary of 1200 words. It is shown in video at https://youtu.be/kjhJ7Q-7Ys0
- The agent has learned and recognized the first 375 of the 1200 words then it has run out of 16 Gb memory :(

I am looking for a definition of a mathematical machine for learning. 
The Mental Processing Unit (MPU) is a computational mental organ introduced 
in detail in the manuscript called "Samu in His Prenatal Development". This 
is a possible definition that is based on the Samu's COP-based Q-learning 
(see http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02889) and on the well-known basic processes 
in infant development called habituation and sensitization. I have performed 
several experiments for creating the definition of MPUs. The SamuVocal in 
question is a strong simplification of the SamuBrain 
(see https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuBrain) because the MPU of SamuVocal uses 
only a vector of Samu's COP-based Q-learning instead of a matrix.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuVocab.git
cd SamuBrain/
~/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/bin/qmake SamuLife.pro
make
./SamuVocab 2>out
```

```
tail -f out|grep "HIGHER-ORDER NOTION MONITOR"
```

```
tail -f out|grep SENSITIZATION
```

```
tail -f out|grep "HABITUATION MONITOR" 
```

```
tail -f out|grep "WORD" 
```


##Important notes:
-In case you have problems with the compiler complaining about nullpt and such, just add the -std=c++11 flag to the CXXFLAGS in the makefile.

- If you see ALSA errors when you run the program, just ignore it, or use the program with the command of ./SamuVocab 2>out redirecting the std::err output to the out file. Don't worry about these "errors", the program operates fine even with them. They are only telling you that the configuration might be bad.

## Experiments with this project

### Samu (Nahshon) has learned a vocabulary of 20 words

Samu has learned the words of the paper 'Babyâ€™s First 10 Words' (see Table 4 in http://waldron.stanford.edu/~babylab/pdfs/Tardifetal2008.pdf)
This version is tagged by 'v20words'. The resulting can be found at https://youtu.be/KGUrMSvD4RI

### Samu (Nahshon) is learning words from Sitton's list of 1200 words

Rebecca Sitton's word list of 1200 high frequency words is used in GameOfLife.cpp.
This version is tagged by 'v1200words'. The resulting can be found at https://youtu.be/kjhJ7Q-7Ys0

### The agent has learned and recognized the first 375 of the 1200 words
